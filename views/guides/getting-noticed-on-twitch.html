        <p><strong>Hello and welcome to another one of my guides!</strong> This time, I would like to try to help people find the best ways to promote themselves and get themselves noticed. These are tips that I have gathered from: my streaming experiences (back in the day), other streamers, community tools and common questions that are asked and answered.  </p>
        <p><strong>Why should I promote myself?</strong><br>
           Viewers don't just instantly come into your stream and watch you. They need to know you exist first. Sure, the directory list is a start; but there are often people above you in the directory, pushing you to the bottom. In other cases, you may be playing a game that others might not even know of! Advertising your content is a great way to get noticed, it is crucial if you are wanting to grow.

        <p><strong><em>How can I get myself noticed?</em></strong><br>
           Allow me tell you through this list...
        </p>
        <p><strong>Social Media</strong><br>
           Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other Social Media sites are shouting "use me" to you! They are such a good way to keep viewers aware of when you are streaming. Announce when you are going to stream and interact with viewers who contact you. Also, don't just go on about your streams. Should something big be happening in the world, comment on it! For example, make sure you wish people a Happy Christmas and so on.
        </p>
        <p><strong><a href="http://twitchdb.tv" class="imgScanned">TwitchDB.tv</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[1] " title="press 1 to open link"></span></strong><br>
           TwitchDB is the website made by <a href="/u/distortednet" class="userTagged imgScanned">/u/distortednet</a><span class="RESUserTag"><a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage" username="distortednet" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void 0"></a></span><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[2] " title="press 2 to open link"></span> that now holds the introductions that were formerly been on this Sub. It allows you as a streamer (or non-streamer) to write a little bit about yourself. This includes information such as games you like to play, your background and your goals. Once you have done this, other benefits are added. For example there is a chance that you will appear on the front page. You may think this is unlikely. But, every time someone loads that page, someone who thought they wouldn't be on the front page will appear there. That person how loaded the page may like what they see and stay. Even if you just get that one viewer out of it, this is worth it as a small streamer.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Collaborations</strong><br>
           Teaming up with other (and hopefully bigger) streamers is often a good way to get more people in. If the people who watch the other streamers like you, they may come and watch your streams when you are on your own. But, don't expect to go to the biggest streamers on Twitch and be accepted on a stream. It is unlikely to happen. Instead, try to work your way up the ranks. Become a regular viewer in someone's stream, and start to play games with them. Hopefully you will start to do it regularly, and you will grow together. But, do not go in saying "I want to play games with you to make my stream bigger," or imply it - just let it happen.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Twitch Teams</strong><br>
           Joining a Twitch Team can be a little difficult. I have only been on a team once, and that was only temporary to test a possible bug on the site. But, it's worth a go! My advice would be to look for streamers who have openings on their teams. A good place to find these is on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/wiki/teams" class="imgScanned">Teams Wiki</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[3] " title="press 3 to open link"></span>. Tip: The fewer people in the team, the better. If there are less people, you are more likely to be seen. This links back into collaborations - play with those on the team.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Hosting</strong><br>
           When you are not streaming, you host/feature other channels. This helps promote them. Similarly to collaborations, try to host streamers that a similar level to you. It is important you do this, as the idea is that they will host you back. The biggest channels on Twitch are unlikely to host some of the smallest. Doing this links into playing with the other streamers.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Contests</strong><br>
           Competitions are a key way to promote yourself. Whether it be through winning a giveaway, or creating content for someone, <a href="http://redd.it/3bz5ct" class="imgScanned">The r/Twitch Highlight Contests</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[4] " title="press 4 to open link"></span>, or any other type of giveaway, people will get a glimpse of your content and hopefully come back for more. Make sure you use your skills. Some people like intros making for streams. If you make one, the streamer is likely to give you a shoutout and everyone will see what you have done. I saw a partnered streamer with ~3.5k viewers do this, and the user who made the content has been really popular ever since. <em>Edit from <a href="/u/linkwall" class="userTagged imgScanned">/u/linkwall</a><span class="RESUserTag"><a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage" username="linkwall" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void 0"></a></span><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[5] " title="press 5 to open link"></span>: Gaming boards and competitions in games such as CS:GO and LoL are great ways to be featured on larger channels.</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Online Services</strong><br>
           I don't personally recommend this, but people find accounts on Twitter that retweet your stream very useful. Some of these accounts have tens of thousands of followers. If you find them useful, go for it! <em>Edit from <a href="/u/Dorbii" class="userTagged imgScanned">/u/Dorbii</a><span class="RESUserTag"><a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage" username="dorbii" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void 0"></a></span><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[6] " title="press 6 to open link"></span>: Some games have forums and other areas when you can advertise you playing that game.</em>

        <p><strong><em>How to not to get noticed</em></strong><br>
           I will explain in another list...
        </p>
        <p><strong>Being Unprofessional</strong><br>
           I don' no bout u, but wen guys right lik dis, I am rly put off da strem. (That says: 'I don't know about you, but when people write like this, I am really put off the stream.') Be professional! For many other the methods listed above, you only get one shot at it. Make sure you get it right. Even basic grammar points such as capital letters at the start of the sentences help people judge what kind of a streamer you are.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Breaking the rules</strong><br>
           Going into a stream and typing in chat 'Check out my stream over at twitch.tv/[Redacted] - it's so much better than this one!' is not a good idea and will likely lead to you being banned in that channel. The same applies for other sites. Rule #3 of this Sub clearly states Channel Advertisment is Banned, yet I see many people making posts (with 0% effort put into them) that only contains a link to the channel. There used to be a 'Who have you watched and what did you think of them?' post. While this was due to other circumstances, this was shut down because of users spamming a link to a channel. Seriously, don't. It just makes people think bad things about you.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Breaking the ToS</strong><br>
           Fake viewers are against the rules of Twitch. You are not getting people to see and like the stream; you are building up a community of people who don't like you because you break the rules. Also, you are not being successful because you are cheating. Reminder that if you see anyone breaking the rules, you should <a href="http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/725568-how-to-file-a-report" class="imgScanned">report them</a><span class="noCtrlF keyNavAnnotation" data-text="[7] " title="press 7 to open link"></span> and include as much evidence as you can find. But, seriously, don't viewbot. You are ruining the Twitch experience for not just yourself, but everyone else.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Begging</strong><br>
           Like I said above, you should not be asking the bigger streamers to play with you, host you, add you to their team, or anything else with the reason of to promote your channel. You should enjoy streaming on Twitch and viewers and followers should just be a side effect. Remember this, otherwise nearly all the methods I mentioned will be no help in the slightest.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Spamming</strong><br>
           If you do wish to use an advertisment service, don't spam it. I sometimes monitor the @TwitchFR feed, and there was one user who spammed the feed with their streams that often, there were three messages stacked on top of each other - all from that one user. The outcome of this was that I muted them. I know little, but sometimes enough French, but this user was making it really hard to distinguish the posts that I wanted to see from the ones I didn't. When people mute you, they don't see your advertisments. Make sure to get the balance right!
        </p>
        <p><strong>Being Desperate</strong><br>
           Never act desperate to keep you viewers in. In fact, don't act at all. Be yourself! You might not know, but it is really obvious when a streamer is acting to impress viewers. It makes you look bad as a streamer. Like I said above, your focus on streaming should be on enjoying it and providing entertainment for others - not on your viewer count. Make sure you have your priorities correct.

        <p>When you say 'there are not enough ways to promote yourself,' you are obviously not looking hard enough ;)  </p>
        <p>I hope this has helped you find new advertising resources and will help your stream grow. Thank you for reading! Please leave any questions and comments you have below :)  </p>
        <p>Comments with edit suggestions are also appreciated. I will add some of them in.</p>
